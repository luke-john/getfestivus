      <p>
        <strong>Frank:</strong> Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for
          my son. I reached for the last one they had, but so did another man.
          As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cosmo:</strong> What happened to the doll?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frank:</strong> It was destroyed. But out of that a new holiday
          was born â€¦ a Festivus for the rest of us!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cosmo:</strong> That must have been some kind of doll.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frank:</strong> She was.
